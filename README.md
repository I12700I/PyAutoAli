## About The Project

PyAutoAli - is an automated system to ensure efficient parsing of AliExpress pages

Why:
* Your time should be focused on other things. For example, by searching for new collections of products
* You don't have to do the same tasks over and over again by checking each page yourself
* You are not required to use the terminal
